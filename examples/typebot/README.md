# Lists with typebot

### Some observations before using list on Typebot, by default Typebot is not ready to work with lists, so has some limitations. 

* Use max of 3 itens in the list, if you use more will be send another list

## How to use


To use lists, you need to use the text bubble followed by button input. ![image](prints/lists.png)
